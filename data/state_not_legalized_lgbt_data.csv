""yet policymakers and the media are doing no favors either to the public or the transgendered by treating their confusions as a right in need of defending rather than as a mental disorder that deserves understanding. this intensely felt sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects. it has gone from calling transgender a mental disorder to calling it a dysphoria. and says: ""the transgendered suffer a disorder of assumption like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. with the transgendered. mchugh goes on: ""for the transgendered. here rests the support for transgender equality. advocates for the transgendered have persuaded several statesincluding california. from striving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor. mchugh goes on and says: ""you wont hear it from those championing transgender equality. when children who reported transgender feelings were tracked without medical or surgical treatment at both vanderbilt university and londons portman clinic. and he says: ""we at johns hopkins universitywhich in the 1960s was the first american medical center to venture into .sexreassignment surgerylaunched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not."" i will insert parenthetically that i remember reading that johns hopkins medical center had been the first hospital in the united states to begin doing sex change operations back in the 60s. he goes on and points out in his article: ""a 2011 study at the karolinska institute in sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered. the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. their suicide mortality rose almost 20fold above the comparable nontransgender population. this disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. i know there are people on the floor that are pushing for civil rights equality for the transgender and to let them go into whatever restrooms they feel like represents the gender they are at that particular time.

"1921",1993-09-28,"R","WI","the debate over allowing gay people in the military raises many difficult issues. our military has always struggled between the history of heroic contributions by gay and lesbian soldiers and the premise that homosexuality could not be allowed in the military setting. further capricious has been the militarys use of a lesbian charge as a vehicle against the advancement of women in the military. american military history is also filled with examples of gay soldiers providing exemplary service. yet for gay citizens. the difference now is this: society at large is only beginning to recognize the blatant prejudice against gay people that lies behind. the costs of discriminating against gay soldiers already have had an added dimension that goes beyond the personal trauma that blacks and victims of racial or religious prejudice have had to face. they had discovered personal correspondence and magazines indicating he was gay. the accomplishments of these members simply evaporate in the face of a single question pertaining to their private life that is unrelated to their potentialwhether or not they are gay. we cannot put a price on traumas imposed on gay soldiers and their loved ones for careers spuriously truncated. * * * legislating someones version of morality is exactly what we do by perpetuating discrimination against gays. in praotics we are telling gay people who want to serve their country that they can only do so by denying who and what they are not only publicly and professionally. which runs short of fully ending discrimination against gay people in the military. as evidenced by the number of even just the admitted gay people who have been serving in the military. ""we do not ban gay and lesbian persons from becoming pastors in our church. is that they almost inevitably did serve with colleagues who were gay. perhaps bearing in mind commonly held stereotypes of gay people. they probably just did not know they stood and perhaps fought beside gay colleagues who chose to keep their private lives to themselves. thus they had no basis upon which to judge what it might be like to serve with gay soldiers. fred pecks heartfelt testimony about the gay ban a few weeks ago. wherein he notes his concerns about his gay sons joining the marines. the implied disintegration of training and order in the face of what can only be raw prejudice underlines a potentially serious problem of military leadership rather than any shortcoming of a gay soldier or the community from which he comes. my accomplishments stood to become totally irrelevant next to the single question of whether or not i was gay. so we must now take the first step that this compromise offers for gay participation in military service."
