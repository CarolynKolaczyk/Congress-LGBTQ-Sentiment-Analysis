""could be viewed as harassment."" outside groups have documented many instances of antigay harassment in the months leading up to the murder. but that he was nevertheless not aware of even a single instance of antigay harassment before the murder. after enduring antigay harassment for many months. it seems clear that if general clark had exercised his responsibility to deal with the serious antigay harassment that was prevalent at fort campbell during his 17 months of command leading up to the murder of private winchell. the potential for such a crime was magnified in this case because of the existing climate of antigay harassment at fort campbell. general clark states that he was not aware of any instance of antigay harassment on the base before the murder. the murder should have made painfully clear that antigay bias and antigay harassment were real and pressing problems at fort campbell. that there was ""no evidence"" that private winchell was killed because he was gay. antigay harassment continued in the months following the murder. the continuing antigay harassment at fort campbell was also accompanied by a sudden exodus of soldiers discharged for violations of the homosexual conduct policy. instead of dealing directly with the problem of antigay harassment. he refused to meet with groups concerned about the welfare of gay soldiers. including a local gay community group. he did not even once speak out against the specific problems of antigay harassment and antigay violence. but hardly sufficient to address the specific problem of antigay harassment. private winchells murder was an antigay hate crime. general clark has been asked repeatedly for instances in which he spoke publicly about antigay harassment. but none of these examples dealt with the specific problem of antigay harassment. and outlines the initiatives we had undertaken to eliminate antigay harassment. in fact the article itself contains no information regarding efforts to address antigay harassmentnot even a statement that such harassment is wrong. there is nothing in the article about antigay harassment. at a rotary club meeting in march 2000--another event listed by general clark as an example of his efforts to address antigay harassmentpress reports. newspaper reports of general clarks rotary club speech contained no mention of any statement condemning antigay harassment. to find out whether in fact general clark made any statements specifically addressing antigay harassment and antigay violence following the winchell murder. major general clark was personally involved in talking to commanders at all levels about the antigay harassment. discrimination against gays is codified in the ban on their service in military. in reporting antigay discrimination. which makes it even more essential for leaders to act quickly and effectively in response to attacks on soldiers perceived to be gay. general clark did not take responsibility for addressing the problem of antigay harassment at fort campbell after the murder. general clark declined to meet with the gay groups. and declined to meet with gay veterans organizations. did not make any public statements or issue any written directives and never publicly communicated an appreciation of the harm caused by the antigay murder. two fort campbell soldiers murdered barry winchell because they believed him to be gay. this murder and additional problems with antigay harassment occurred during the tenure of commander clark and there has been no response.","before"
