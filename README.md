# Sentiment Analysis of LGBTQ Issues in US Congressional Speeches
This project was originally completed for a Text as Data course. The goal of this project is to evaluate the sentiment of US Congressional speeches discussing LGBTQ issues, and investigate whether there is a relationship between speech sentiment and the passing of LGBTQ legislation, specifically the legalization of same-sex marriage at the state level. It also explores the effect of speakers’ state and political party on the sentiment of LGBTQ related speeches.
