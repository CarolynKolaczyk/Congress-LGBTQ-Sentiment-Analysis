```
For Democrats vs Republicans:
We can see that both distributions seem to be centered around zero, but the Democrats distribution seems to be ever so slightly left skewed?

For before vs after:
Both seem to be centered around zero

For D vs R, before vs after:
We can see that there are much less data points for after legalization. This makes it difficult to do comparison, especially for Republicans. However, this can also be informative, as it tells us Republicans are discussing lgbtq subjects much less than Democrats. 


```{r}
# average sentiment score for each
print(paste('Avg Sentiment Score for Democrats', mean(D_scores)))
print(paste('Avg Sentiment Score for Republicans', mean(R_scores)))

```
Interesting... both scores are negative but Democrat one is more negative! Not what I expected

** (Add avg sentiment score for other states not included here, for comparison) ** 

```{r}
# calculate avg score before and after, for both D and R

# print
print(paste('Avg Sentiment Score for Democrats Before', mean(D_before)))
print(paste('Avg Sentiment Score for Democrats After', mean(D_after)))
print(paste('Avg Sentiment Score for Republicans Before', mean(R_before)))
print(paste('Avg Sentiment Score for Republicans After', mean(R_after)))
```
We can see that in both cases, the average sentiment scores increases after gay marriage is legalized. It increases by 0.1675 for the Democrats, and 0.3746 for the Republicans. Again, not what I would have expected, but interesting. It seems that Republicans sentiment about lgbt issues increases more after legalization than Democrats. This could make sense if we think about how many/most Democrats already support gay marriage, so it makes sense that their stance wouldn't be as affected by legalization. 
(Maybe doing confidence intervals will make these differences less significant? Can I even do confidence intervals since it's not really a sample?)

#### Extreme Examples
Looking at documents with highest and lowest sentiment scores, to evaluate accuracy of our metric
```{r}
# add sentiment score to corp
docvars(corp) <- docvars(dfm)
# get sentiment scores
scores <- docvars(corp, 'sentiment_score')
scores <- sort(scores)
# get top 5 and bottom 5 values
top_5 <- head(scores)
bottom_5 <- tail(scores)
top_5
bottom_5
```
```{r}
# get most negative doc
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==-51)))
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==-19)))
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==16)))
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==13)))
```

During pride month, describing how Washington recently became one of 12 states where gay marriage is now legal, and how proud they are of the progress and of the community.


```{r}
# get info about these texts
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==-51)))
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==-19)))
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==16)))
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp, sentiment_score==13)))
```

```{r}
# print legalization date for these states to see how close to it these are
df_marriage[df_marriage$State == 'MA',]$Date
df_marriage[df_marriage$State == 'MN',]$Date
df_marriage[df_marriage$State == 'CA',]$Date
df_marriage[df_marriage$State == 'WA',]$Date

None are super close, except for the most negative example, which comes from MA, and is about 6 months before.

We can see that for states that legalized gay marriage before the supreme court decision, Democrats have a higher range of sentiment scores in the years 2000+. Everything else sees to stay about the same, centered randomly around zero. Although we can also see on the second graph a period between about 1987 and 1997 with more negative points than usual. This most likely corresponds with the AIDS epidemic (add a source with dates for this).

#### Extreme examples from other states
```{r}
docvars(corp_2) <- docvars(dfm_2)
# get sentiment scores
scores <- docvars(corp_2, 'sentiment_score')
scores <- sort(scores)
# get top 5 and bottom 5 values
top_5 <- head(scores)
bottom_5 <- tail(scores)
top_5
bottom_5
```

```{r}
# print most neg, 2 most pos
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp_2, sentiment_score==-17)))
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp_2, sentiment_score==22)))
print(as.character(corpus_subset(corp_2, sentiment_score==20)))
```

text1796 : doc with the most negative text. This is definitely rated correctly. The speeches in this doc are incredibly anti-trans. They are quoting articles from individuals who regretted their decision, and transgender individuals who are not against bathroom bills. They argue that being transgender is a mental illness and should have stayed classified as such, rather than being changed to gender dysphoria. They go on and on. Yikes. 

text1799 : speeches in support of the lgbt community, of lgbt congress members, in honor of pride month. This makes sense for a very positive rating. 

text1789 : Is celebrating victories for the lgbt community. References the upcoming supreme court decision, hopes they will legalize gay marriage. We even see some of the same points being made as in the previous text. 

All in all, it seems the positive ones are during pride month. And the negative one is some anti-trans rhetoric. 

```{r}
# get info about these texts
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp_2, sentiment_score==-17)))
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp_2, sentiment_score==22)))
print(docvars(corpus_subset(corp_2, sentiment_score==20)))
```
Interesting that these are all from Texas.


# Research Question:
- How does the passing of lgbt related legislation affect the attitudes of congress members towards the lgbt community?
    - can edit a bit...
    
# Notes:
- decided to do sentence level instead of kwic, because frequently people list lgbt as "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender", and so the same kwic context would turn up for each of those. 
- when reading in data, some lines had encoding errors or format errors. Just dropped these lines.
